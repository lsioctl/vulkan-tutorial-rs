# Vulkan tutorial in Rust

I started Vulkan tutorial in C++ but I would like to spend more time in Rust.
Last time I tried I had issue with the Rust tutorial because Rust ecosystem is moving
faster than the documentation.

Moreover, it seems that Ash, and not Vulkanalia may have more traction, as seen on
Vulkan pages:
https://www.vulkan.org/tools#download-these-essential-development-tools

Also, for now (July 2025):
* Ash has more contributors (94 vs 15)

On GH, for what it worth


## Encountered issues

* winit has changed, I think even from what I did last year on webgpu
